I am Alex Vakhitov, a software engineer from London, United Kingdom. I have rich experience in backend development. Also, I am good at Haskell.

I'm interested in functional programming, code quality and automation, type theory and theory categories.

Currently, I'm working in CloudKB where I'm trying to build a product that will improve the UK's energy industry.
