With a simple example, I want to show what currying is and where we can use it. Still, functional programming is a new (old) trend and is becoming a standard in general.

> In mathematics and computer science, currying is the technique of translating the evaluation of a function that takes multiple arguments into evaluating a sequence of functions, each with a single argument. For example, a function that takes two arguments, one from X and one from Y, and produces outputs in Z, by currying is translated into a function that takes a single argument from X and produces as outputs functions from Y to Z Currying is related to, but not the same as, partial application.
